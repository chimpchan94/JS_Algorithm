# Dynamic Programming

### Define
- A method for slving a complex problem by breaking in down into a collection of simpler subproblems, solving each of those subproblems just once, and storing their solutions


### Overlapping Subproblems
- 하위 요소들이 반복되어야 한다.

### Optimal substructure

### Memoization
- Storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again


### Tabulation
- Storing the result of a previous result in a "table" (usually an array)

Usually done using iteration

Better space complexity can be achieved using tabulation
