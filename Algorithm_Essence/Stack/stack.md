# Stack

- A LIFO data structure!
  The last element added to the stack will be the first element removed from list

- The Call Stack

### Where Stacks are used

- Managing function invocations
- Undo / Redo
- Routing (the history object) is treated like a stack

### Big O of Stacks

- Insertion - O(1)
- Removal - O(1)
- Searching - O(N)
- Access - O(N)

### RECAP

- Stacks are a LIFO data structure where the last value in is always the first one out.
- Stacks are used to handle function invocations (the call stack), for operations like undo/redo, and for routing (remember pages you have visited and go back/forward) and much more!
- They are not a build in data structure in JavaScript, but are relatively simple to implement
