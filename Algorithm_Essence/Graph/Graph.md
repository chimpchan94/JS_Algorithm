# Graph

### What are graphs
- a graph data sturcture consists of a finite (and possibly mutable) set of vertices or nodes or points, together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph


### Uses for graphs
- social networks
- location / mapping
- routing algorithms
- visual hierarchy
- file system optimizations
- everywhere


### Terms
- Vertex : a node
- Edge : connection between nodes
- Diredcted/Undirected - directions assigned to distanced between vertices

### Traverse
- 트리는 다른 노드로 갈 때 경로가 하나 밖에 없다.

### Graph Traversal uses
- Peer to peer networking
- Web crawlers
- Finding "closest" matches/recommendations
- Shortest path problems
- GPS Navigation
- Solving mazes
- AI (shortest path to win the game)
