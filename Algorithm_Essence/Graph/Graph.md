# Graph

### What are graphs
- a graph data sturcture consists of a finite (and possibly mutable) set of vertices or nodes or points, together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph


### Uses for graphs
- social networks
- location / mapping
- routing algorithms
- visual hierarchy
- file system optimizations
- everywhere


### Terms
- Vertex : a node
- Edge : connection between nodes
- Diredcted/Undirected - directions assigned to distanced between vertices
