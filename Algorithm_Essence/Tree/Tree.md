# Tree

### Objectives
- Define what a tree is
- compare and contrast trees and lists
- explain the differences between trees, binary trees, and binary search trees
- implement operations on binary search trees

### What is a tree?
- a data structure that consists of nodes in a parent / child relationship


### Difference btw lists
- lists : linear
- trees : non-linear

### terms
- root : the top node in a tree
- child : a node directly connected to another node when moving away from the Root
- parent :  the converse notion of a child
- siblings : a group of nodes with the same parent.
- leaf : a node with no children
- edge : the connection between one noe and another

### applications of trees
- HTML DOM
- Network routing
- Abstract syntax tree
- Artificial intelligence
- Computer file systems

### kinds of tree
- Trees 
- Binary Trees (Each node should have at most two children)
- Binary Search Tree (Special at search)

### How BSTS WORK
- Every parent node has at most two children
- Every node to the left of a parent node is always less than the parent
- Every node to the right of a parent node is always greater than the parent


### Big O of BST

(AVG - Notguaranteed!)
- insertion - O(log n)
- searching - O(log n)
