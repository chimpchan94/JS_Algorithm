# Linked list

- A data structure that contains a head, tail, and length property.

- Linked Lists consist of nodes, and each node has a value and a pointer to another node or null

### Method of Linked list

- Push
- Popping : Removing a node from the end of the linked list
- Shifting: Removing a new node from the beginning of the linked list
- Unshifting: Adding a new node to the beginning of the linked list
- Get : Retrieving a node by it's position in the linked list.
- Set: Changing the value of a node based on it's position in the linked list.
- Insert: Adding a node to the linked list at a specific position
- Remove: Removing a node from the linked list at a specific position
- Reverse: Reversing the linked list in place

### Big O of singly linked lists

- insertion - O(1);
- removal - it depends... O(1) or O(N)
- searching - O(N)
- Access - O(N)

### RECAP

- Singly linked lists are an excellent alternative to arrays when insertion and eletion at the beginning are frequently required
- Arrays contain a build in index whereas linked lists do not
- The idea of list data structure that consists of nodes is the foundation for other data structures like Stacks and Queues
